class AppleScriptExecutor:
    """Handles AppleScript execution with locking and retry mechanisms.

    This class implements process-level locking to prevent race conditions when
    multiple AppleScript commands are executed concurrently. The lock ensures
    that only one AppleScript executes at a time, preventing potential conflicts
    and ensuring reliable operation with Things 3.

    Serialization is guaranteed WITHIN each event loop - which is where
    concurrent osascript calls actually originate (e.g. bulk fan-outs gather
    tasks on a single loop). Across loops, callers are inherently sequential
    (asyncio.run() blocks the calling thread until the loop finishes), so
    process-wide serialization is preserved in every real usage even though
    each loop gets its own Lock instance.

    Locks are keyed per-event-loop (mirroring hq-5xa's operation_queue fix)
    rather than using a single class-level asyncio.Lock(), because CPython's
    asyncio.Lock only binds its internal loop reference on a CONTENDED
    acquire (a second waiter queueing while the lock is held) - an
    uncontended acquire never binds. A class-level lock that experiences a
    contended acquire on loop A becomes permanently bound to loop A; any
    later contended acquire from a *different* loop B then raises
    "RuntimeError: ... is bound to a different event loop" instead of
    serializing. Keying by the running loop in a WeakKeyDictionary avoids
    this entirely - each loop gets its own Lock, created lazily on first
    use. Note: a lock entry for an abandoned loop is not reclaimed by this
    alone and may persist for the life of the process - same bounded,
    inert-entry retention caveat as the operation_queue's WeakKeyDictionary
    (the Lock object itself holds no resources and is simply unheld).
