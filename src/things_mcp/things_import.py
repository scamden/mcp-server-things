"""Lazy, timeout-bounded import of the ``things`` (things.py) package.

The ``things`` package performs a module-level, synchronous, unbounded
``glob.iglob()`` scan of the Things 3 Group Containers directory at import
time (``things/database.py``, resolving the sqlite database path). If that
filesystem path stalls -- a sleeping external volume, FileVault unlock
delay, or heavy Spotlight/Time Machine contention -- a plain ``import
things`` at module load time can hang the whole process silently, well
before the MCP stdio handshake completes.

This module moves that import off the synchronous critical path: the first
call to :func:`get_things` performs the import in a background daemon
thread and joins it with a bounded timeout, emitting boot markers so a
stall is loudly diagnosable instead of a silent hang. Subsequent calls
return the cached module instantly with no thread/markers involved.

    On first call, imports ``things`` in a background daemon thread and

    import completes within the timeout, the resulting module is cached
    and returned on this and all subsequent calls (subsequent calls do not
    spawn a thread or emit boot markers -- they return the cached module
    instantly).

    If the import does not complete within the timeout, this raises
    :class:`ThingsImportTimeoutError` and emits a boot marker documenting
    the stall. Note that the background daemon thread is not killed in
    this case -- it may still complete the import later. A subsequent call
    to ``get_things()`` will notice the module landed in ``sys.modules``
    (or in our cache, if the earlier thread's result gets stored) and
    return it gracefully rather than re-attempting or re-raising.

    If the import thread raised an exception (e.g. ``ImportError``), that
    exception is re-raised here (on the call that observed the failure).
