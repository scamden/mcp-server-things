"""Session fixtures for the opt-in live Things 3 smoke suite.

This whole directory is skipped unless BOTH:
  - THINGS_MCP_LIVE_TESTS=1 is set in the environment, AND
  - Things 3 is actually running (probed via a fast, non-launching
    `application "Things3" is running` AppleScript call).

When the suite does run, a single throwaway project (see
`SMOKE_PROJECT_PREFIX`) is created once per session and every test-created
item (todos, the project itself) is tracked and trashed in a
session-scoped teardown that runs even if tests fail (via
`request.addfinalizer`). Teardown verifies via things.py that every
tracked uuid is actually trashed and raises (test error) listing any
leftover uuids if not - this suite must never leave live data behind.

LIVE-WRITE SAFETY: every fixture in this file creates its own brand-new
project scoped to this test session. Nothing here ever writes into,
moves into, or otherwise touches a pre-existing project/area/heading -
see COMMON.md's "LIVE-WRITE SAFETY" rule.
