"""Parameter-reach test generator for every write MCP tool (hq-f0w.9).

Why (failure class 4 - declared parameter never asserted to reach the
backend): add_todo(heading=...) was declared in server.py but silently
dropped on the AppleScript path and no test passed heading as an argument
and then checked it actually reached Things. This file closes that gap
generically: for every mutating (write) tool registered on the FastMCP
server, and for every parameter FastMCP reports for that tool, a unique
sentinel value is sent through the real ThingsMCPServer -> ThingsTools ->
AppleScriptManager stack (with a recording fake in place of
AppleScriptManager) and the test asserts the sentinel (or, for
booleans/enums, the corresponding AppleScript property / URL-scheme key)
appears in at least one captured AppleScript script string or URL-scheme
call. things.py (list_id/list_title resolution) is patched with canned
data so every path is reachable without a live Things 3 database.

Design (data-driven, per the bead's "no silent passes" requirement):
  - MUTATING_TOOLS enumerates every tool this file has explicitly
    classified as a write tool needing parameter-reach coverage. Any
    OTHER tool registered on the server that isn't in MUTATING_TOOLS and
    isn't in READ_TOOLS fails test_every_registered_tool_is_classified
    with "classify this tool as read or write" - this is what makes the
    generator data-driven: a newly added tool cannot silently escape
    coverage.
  - For each mutating tool, BASE_KWARGS supplies the minimal valid
    arguments needed to reach a real write attempt (e.g. add_todo needs
    title; update_todo needs id).
  - PARAM_ASSERTIONS[(tool, param)] is an optional override describing
    exactly how to build the sentinel value and how to detect it in the
    captured calls, for parameters that aren't a plain pass-through
    string (booleans, enums, ints). Parameters without an override use
    the DEFAULT_STRING_HANDLER (unique alphanumeric sentinel string,
    looked for verbatim in any captured script or URL params).
  - IGNORED lists parameters that legitimately never reach Things
    (mode/limit-style plumbing, or ones covered by a dedicated
    xfail-with-bead-reference below), each with a one-line reason.

Any real dropped-parameter bug found while writing this file is NOT fixed
here (out of this bead's scope) - it is recorded in DROPPED_PARAMS below,
each wired to a strict xfail plus a bead id filed as follow-up work.
