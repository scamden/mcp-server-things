"""hq-gbl.5: Input-space matrix for every WRITE tool at the MCP boundary.

Table-driven coverage of every declared parameter across value classes
(omitted / '' / whitespace-only / typical / special characters / invalid)
for every write tool listed in the bead: add_todo, update_todo,
bulk_update_todos, delete_todo, add_project, update_project, add_area,
update_area, add_tags, remove_tags, create_tag, move_record,
bulk_move_records, add_checklist_items, prepend_checklist_items,
replace_checklist_items.

Mocking strategy: reuse test_parameter_reach.py's
RecordingAppleScriptManager (patch targets, things.py lookup patches,
server construction) verbatim - it already solves script/URL capture and
things.py patching for every write path. Every call is driven through a
real ThingsMCPServer + in-memory fastmcp.Client(server.mcp), exercising
the real validation logic in server.py/tools_helpers/*.

Each CASES entry is (tool, args, expectation):
    - ok(route=..., contains=[...], url_contains={...})
        -> call succeeds (structured_content.success is not False); the
           call must have used the given capture route ('applescript',
           'url_add', 'url_update', or 'url_json'), and every string in
           `contains` must appear verbatim in the captured script text (for
           AppleScript-route cases) or in the JSON-encoded captured URL
           params (for URL-route cases). `url_contains`, if given, maps a
           URL param key to a required substring of its value.
    - write_error(code, no_capture=True/False)
        -> structured {"success": False, "error": code, ...} (UPPER_SNAKE,
           or the documented lower_snake exceptions for delete_todo). When
           no_capture is True (the default for auth-gate/pre-write
           validation errors), asserts NO AppleScript/URL call was made.
    - tool_error() -> pydantic rejects the input before the tool body runs
        (fastmcp raises ToolError).

A completeness check (TestCompleteness) at the bottom introspects every
write tool's declared parameters via Client.list_tools() and fails if any
(tool, param) pair has fewer than 3 CASES entries.

Known, deliberately-NOT-fixed bugs encoded as observed behavior (not
xfail - the live suite owns xfails per GBL_COMMON.md; comments cite the
owning bead):
  - hq-z5d: move_record destination handling for 'someday'/'anytime'
    fallback quirks are exercised as observed, not asserted as "correct".
  - hq-exe (FIXED): add_todo/add_checklist_items/prepend_checklist_items/
    replace_checklist_items now reject a request with more than 100
    checklist items with TOO_MANY_CHECKLIST_ITEMS before any write; exactly
    100 items is still accepted. See CASES below for the 100-ok/101-rejected
    pairs for each of the four tools.
  - hq-r87: a whitespace-only tag name (e.g. "  spacey  ") is accepted
    as a distinct tag after stripping - not rejected.
  - hq-nb1 (FIXED): all four TagCreationPolicy states are now reachable
    both via THINGS_MCP_TAG_CREATION_POLICY (env) and via
    ThingsMCPConfig(tag_creation_policy=...) (constructor) - see
    config.py's model_validator(mode='after') reconciliation. This file's
    CASES continue to construct servers via
    ThingsMCPConfig(tag_creation_policy=...) (through `_make_server`'s
    `tag_policy` kwarg) since that's the simplest in-process path; the env
    var path is covered separately in tests/unit/test_config_tag_policy.py.
